# Betterment Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Betterment

* When was the company incorporated?

Betterment Holdings, Inc, the parent company for Betterment LLC (originally founded in April 2009) and Betterment Securities, was established in Delaware on January  29, 2008.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Jon Stein (Columbia MBA grad) and Eli Broverman (lawyer out of NYU Law)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Stein initially formed the idea for the company in 2008 when considering the mistakes he was making with his own personal investments. He wanted to build a platform that "told me what to do with my money, and then did it" (1), so he would not fall into the common bad investing habits, such as trying to time the market, selling winners too soon, and churning his portfolio. He initially planned to build the entire platform himself, but had no programming background, so he turned to his roommate at the time, Harvard CS major, Sean Owen. With Stein and Owen building the service, Broverman covering the regulatory implications and Stein's girlfriend, Polina Khentov, a graphic designer, designing the prototype, the idea turned into a viable business plan.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Starting in August 2008, Stein and Broverman started with $320k from a personal savings and angel funding. The site goes live in May 2010, and the firm enters **TechCrush Disrupt New York** in June, winning the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor". In less than 24 hours, 500 people have signed up for the service. In November, the firm receives Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners to the tune of $2m (plus another $1m from a few other investors). In October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided $10m in Series B funding. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Betterment is primarily a retail robo-advisor, designed to automate goal-based investing at comparatively low fees, while also providing cash management and retirement services. The idea is to remove the behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and produce a portfolio rooted in modern portfolio theory (MPT), utilizing low cost ETFs, that automatically rebalances periodically and implements tax-loss harvesting to maximize returns for an investors desired level of risk. Along with MPT, the platform's algorithms rely on the Black-Litterman model, Fama-French model, CAPM, and Monte Carlo simulations.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
