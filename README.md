# Betterment Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Betterment

* When was the company incorporated?

Betterment Holdings, Inc, the parent company for Betterment LLC (originally founded in April 2009) and Betterment Securities, was established in Delaware on January  29, 2008.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Jon Stein (Columbia MBA grad) and Eli Broverman (lawyer out of NYU Law)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Stein initially formed the idea for the company in 2008 when considering the mistakes he was making with his own personal investments. He wanted to build a platform that "told me what to do with my money, and then did it" (1), so he would not fall into the common bad investing habits, such as trying to time the market, selling winners too soon, and churning his portfolio. He initially planned to build the entire platform himself, but had no programming background, so he turned to his roommate at the time, Harvard CS major, Sean Owen. With Stein and Owen building the service, Broverman covering the regulatory implications and Stein's girlfriend, Polina Khentov, a graphic designer, designing the prototype, the idea turned into a viable business plan.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Starting in August 2008, Stein and Broverman started with $320k from a personal savings and angel funding. The site goes live in May 2010, and the firm enters **TechCrush Disrupt New York** in June, winning the award of "Biggest New York Disruptor". In less than 24 hours, 500 people have signed up for the service. In November, the firm receives Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Partners to the tune of $2m (plus another $1m from a few other investors). In October 2012, Menlo Ventures provided $10m in Series B funding. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Betterment is primarily a retail robo-advisor, designed to automate goal-based investing at comparatively low fees, while also providing cash management and retirement services. The idea is to remove the behavioral biases that most investors exhibit and produce a portfolio rooted in modern portfolio theory (MPT), utilizing low cost ETFs, that automatically rebalances periodically and implements tax-loss harvesting to maximize returns for an investors desired level of risk. Along with MPT, the platform's algorithms rely on the Black-Litterman model, Fama-French model, CAPM, and Monte Carlo simulations.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? 

The company's intended customers are young Millenials that like to due things on their own, via technology, and do not have enough assets (or the desire) to work with a professional money manager, as well as those that see traditional advisors' fees as too high and the service underwhelming. This market size is obviously enormous, with a reported 72m Millenials in the US as of 2019 (5).
While there are many robo-advisors out there, including large traditional financial institutions starting their own, Betterment is the largest independent firm in the space, with 480,000 customers and over $22b in AUM (as of March 2020). They offer the lowest management fee (0.25%) and $0 minimum balances (compared to $500 at Wealthfront and $100k at Personal Capital). They also offer fractional share investing and asset location (ie, tax coordination) across accounts, which many others do not. Lastly, Betterment's site is filled with educational articles and white papers aimed at new investors.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? 

Betterment has a large technology stack. They use Ruby on Rails for app development as well as server-side programming using Ruby, Java, Scala, C#, C++, and Python. They make extensive use of the cloud, both via AWS and the Google Cloud Platform. Mobile apps are developed using Objective-C, Swift, Java and Kotlin, and they are further building the stack by diving into Dart and Flutter. Other technologies used in the firm include PHP, HTML, Javascript, and MySQL.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Betterment is a part of the Wealth Management industry, specifically targeting the retail market, serving as a robo-advisor. In fact, Betterment is considered one of the very first robo-advisors, a distinction that has led to its popularity versus competitors as it enjoyed a first-mover advantage. As previously mentioned, the firm caters to young adults that prefer low fees and instructive technology, as compared to high fee financial advisors that provide subpar services or only cater to high net worth individuals. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

While the financial techniques used are nothing new (eg, MPT, CAPM, etc) to the investment community, the major trend that robo-advisors has capitilized on is the distrubtion channel, namely the technological innovations of the past 10 years. Aware that the younger generation wanted to do everything digitally, Betterment and others jumped on this opportunity to offer low cost wealth management with the need for mininal (if any) human interaction. Now, young (middle class) adults can let the robo-advisor automatically rebalance their desired asset allocation, monitor their portfolio on their mobile phone or tablet, and rest assured the best techniques are being used for tax-loss harvesting and asset location across their portfolio, without paying exhorbinant fees to a traditional financial advisor unable to beat the market anyway.

Since the launch of Betterment in 2010, the landscape as evolved immensely, with assets managed by robo-advisors jumping to $19b by 2014. The first robo-advisor was then launched in China in 2015, and in 2016 the first platform targeted to women, Ellevest, launched. Global robo-advisor AUM by 2017 had hit $225b, with traditional money managers, such as Vanguard, entering the market, and the top three independent advisors managing nearly 560k client accounts. By then end of 2020, the Chinese market is expected to $900b in AUM, with global assets shooting to $4.6t by 2022.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The domain contains both independent robo-advisors as well as units at traditional money managers trying to compete in the space. Below is a table of AUM and # of client accounts at the largest such firms.
