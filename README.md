## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

* When was the company incorporated?

Betterment Holdings, Inc, the parent company for Betterment LLC (originally founded in April 2009) and Betterment Securities, was established in Delaware on January 29, 2008.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Jon Stein (Columbia MBA grad) and Eli Broverman (lawyer out of NYU Law)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

Stein initially formed the idea for the company in 2008 when considering the mistakes he was making with his own personal investments. He wanted to build a platform that "told me what to do with my money, and then did it" (1), so he would not fall into the common bad investing habits, such as trying to time the market, selling winners too soon, and churning his portfolio. He initially planned to build the entire platform himself, but had no programming background, so he turned to his roommate at the time, Harvard CS major, Sean Owen. With Stein and Owen building the service, Broverman covering the regulatory implications and Stein's girlfriend, Polina Khentov, a graphic designer, designing the prototype, the idea turned into a viable business plan.
